# Mini-Project: The Vacuum Environment
This week you will have no tests and no set guidelines. 
Your task will be to complete the code stub you will find in the `vacuum.py` file and build an environment to control an automatic vacuum cleaner. 
Your environment should adhere to the gymnasium format, though you donâ€™t need to render anything. 
Start by implementing the basic requirements that should be learned (e.g. moving) before adding options for greater difficulty. 
This could include extra dirty spots in the room, different apartment layouts, breakable vacuum cleaners or even additional functions like dusting. 
To test if your design works as expected, you should try to run an agent on your environment from time to time. 
Ideally, it will learn slower or not at all whenever you add a new difficulty. 
If your design decisions are flawed this may make the task easier or much too hard, so make sure to check. Good luck and have fun!


## Level 2
DISCUSS: [Carolin] IMO Rendering is not too interesting bc it might be time consuming to implement. What is meant by utility wrappers?

Beautify, e.g. rendering
Possibly add utility wrappers

## Level 3 
Of course, in reality our vacuum cleaner should be able to handle any room and maybe have different strategies for different rooms and situations.
We can model this by Contextual Markov Decision Processes ([Hallak et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02259)).
In cMDPs, depending on the *context*, we get a slightly different MDP. For example, in the context (ðŸ˜‰) of vaccum cleaners we might have a dusty context or a task with loads of obstacles.
For more information you can check out our benchmark library CARL for examples and more info ([github](https://github.com/automl/CARL), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04500)).
Maybe you already have some parameters in your environment changing the behavior, these might actually be context features!
If you have defined a cMDP, try training an agent on them. How does it perform?
Btw, we are actively working on CARL/cMDPs and are always happy for support and looking for theses!
